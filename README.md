## Motivation, Goals, and Disclaimers

This is a personal project that serves as an avenue to learn more about socket programming in C++.
I intend to make this project a stepping stone to ground my understanding of backend web transactions and 
networking. The initial roadmap is to write an HTTP server which supports the following: 

- [x] Listen to incoming network connection
- [x] Accept incoming network connection and process them
- [x] Accepts request from the client
- [x] Returns response to the client
- [ ] File upload
  - [x] text and documents
  - [x] images
  - [x] video
  - [ ] mp3
