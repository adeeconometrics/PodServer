## Motivation, Goals, and Disclaimers

This is a personal project that serves as an avenue to learn more about socket programming in C++.
I intend to make this project a stepping stone to ground my understanding of backend web transactions and 
networking. The initial roadmap is to write an HTTP server which supports the following: 

- [ ] Listen to incoming network connection
- [ ] Accept incoming network connection and process them
- [ ] Accepts request from the client
- [ ] Returns response to the client
